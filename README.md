SnakeID is a WIP tool to teach people to identify snakes based on their photos.

I aim to make this a largely crowd sourced project with users uploading their own photos and 
contributing to the pages on each species. The live version will be hosted @ snakes.n8ta.com
when ready for launch. Get in touch with me if you are interested in contributing to this project.
