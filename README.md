SnakeID is a WIP tool to teach people to identify snakes based on their photos.

I aim to make this a largely crowd sourced project with users uploading their own photos and 
contributing to the pages on each species. The live version will be hosted @ snakes.n8ta.com
when ready for launch. Get in touch with me if you are interested in contributing to this project.

Todo:
- Restructure models to support more detailed taxonomy superfamilies etc.
- Import taxonomy
- Import images from reddit with rake task
- Build image quizzing bot
- Style this shit
- Built report system
- All the user shit like email passwords
- Build out admin roles for power users
- Gameification
- Fit Splines
